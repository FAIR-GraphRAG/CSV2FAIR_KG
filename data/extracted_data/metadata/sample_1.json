        "Paired-end reads were harvested from Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer after quality filtering. Firstly, Q30 was used to perform quality control. After 3’ adaptor-trimming and low quality reads trimming by cutadapt software (v1.9.2), based on these high quality reads, CloudSeq used different softwares to analyse mRNAs. The high quality reads were aligned to the reference genome (UCSC hg19) guided by the Ensembl gtf gene annotation file with hisat2 software (v2.04). Then, cuffdiff software (part of cufflinks, v2.2.1) was used to get the fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPRM) as the expression profiles of mRNA, and fold change and p-value were calculated based on FPKM, differentiallymRNA were identified. And GO and Pathway analysis were performed on these target genes. GO and Pathway enrichment analysis were also performed based on the differentially expressed mRNAs.",
